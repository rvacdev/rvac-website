<ul>
	<li>1936:
		<p>WPA built the rock building that would eventually house the River Valley Arts Center.</p></li>

	<li>1981:
		<p>After a June planning meeting, a $5,000 grant from the Junior 
		Auxiliary, and commitments from community leaders for over $10,000, 
		the River Valley Arts Center Foundation, Inc. was formed.</p>
		<p>The Arts Center officially opened its doors to the public at an all 
		day celebration and ribbon cutting ceremony on October 7th in the 
		borrowed building on West Main Street.</p>
		<p>Articles of Incorporation prepared by Lu Hardin were signed in December 1981. A Board of
		 Directors was formed and Richard Barton served as the first Executive Director.</p></li>

	<li>1984:
		<p>After three years the borrowed building was 
		sold and the arts center needed a new home. The City 
		of Russellville agreed to lease the rock building built 
		by the WPA in 1936 which had formerly been the public pool 
		bathhouse located in the City Park. The building was 
		renovated with community donations and labor as well as the 
		assistance of Van Horn construction.</p></li>

	<li>1999:
		<p>A Memorial Garden was designed and added to honor the six 
		residents who were lost in an airline crash, including then
		 Arts Center president Gordon McLerran.</p></li>

	<li>Now:
		<p>The Main building now houses a main gallery space with monthly
		 exhibits, a smaller gallery called the New Age Gallery, a 
		 classroom, gift shop, office, restrooms, galley kitchen and 
		 a receptionist area. The original pool chemical storage building 
		 was a challenging renovation, but now functions as a kiln room. 
		 A small building was donated by City Corporation and moved to 
		 its current location to house the pottery studio.</p>
		<p>Most of the operating budget for the River Valley Arts Center comes
		 from memberships and support of area residents, with some funding
		  from small corporate and foundation grants and the support of the 
		  Arkansas Arts Council. Class fees go towards supplies and paid instructors. </p> 
		<p>A full time Executive Director and a part time administrative assistant,
		 and a part time artist in residence comprise the staff of the Arts Center. 
		With the help of the Board of Directors, community volunteers, and partnerships 
		with area organizations we are able to provide an array of visual and performing
		 arts programs and venues which enriches the Arkansas River Valley communities.</p></li>
